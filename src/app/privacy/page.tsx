      </h3>
      <p>
        We are a global company. Information about you may be stored and
        processed in the European Economic Area, the United States or any other
        country in which our Company or agents or contractors maintain
        facilities, and by accessing our websites and using our mobile apps,
        software and services, you consent to the transfer of your information
        outside of your country. Such countries may have laws which are
        different, and potentially not as protective as the laws of your own
        country.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-bold">Accuracy of Personal data</h3>
      <p>
        We do our best to ensure that the personal data we hold and use is
        accurate. We rely on the customers we do business with to disclose to us
        all relevant information and to inform us of any changes.

      <h3 className="font-bold">Notice to End Users of Customers</h3>
      <p>
        Most of our services are intended for use by organizations. Where the
        services are made available to you through an organization (e.g. your
        employer), that organization is the administrator of the services and is
        responsible for the accounts and/or service over which it has control.
        Please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your
        use of the services is subject to that organization&apos;s policies. We
        are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an
        administrator&apos;s organization, which may be different from this
        policy.

      <h3 className="font-bold">Children&apos;s Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Because of the nature of our business, our services are not designed to
        appeal to minors. We do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any
        information from anyone under the age of 17 (or other age as required by
        local law). If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your
        child has provided us with personal data, please contact us immediately.
        If we learn that we have collected any personal data in violation of
        applicable law, we will promptly take steps to delete such information
        and terminate the child&apos;s account.
